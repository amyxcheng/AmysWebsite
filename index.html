        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Amy; welcome to my website! I am currently a second year double degree student studying Computer Science at the
          University of Waterloo, and Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University. I am an eager learner and lover of
          creating new things.<br>
          I originally intended to create this website and use it as a platform for showcasing some of the projects I've worked on.
          However, I would also like to use this site as a place for me to express myself beyond the projects and boasting of relevant work experiences
          in attempts to attract job recruiters. Whether it is through words, pictures, art, or code, my goal is to be able to create
          a sort of public, creative diary (such as with social media, but without the FOMO feeling that comes with scrolling through endless
          amounts of perfectly edited photos posted by friends and strangers alike). <br>
          This website was created using HTML/CSS and Javascript after taking introductory online courses for those languages.
          It is hosted through my <a href="https://github.com/amyxcheng">Github</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p> In my spare time, I love playing sports! Some of my favourite include soccer, figure skating, nordic skiing, and badminton,
          but there are few sports I haven't tried. I am currently learning Muay Thai, Dragon Boating, and playing
          intramural soccer at university.<br>
          I also love being outdoors and surrounded by nature. Watching sunsets and sunrises, climbing mountains, looking for
          shooting stars, swimming in rivers and oceans, and sitting by a warm fire are just a few things that make me immeasurably happy.

        </p>
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p> I can ride a unicycle (...more or less). </p>
